# Exact Diagonalization
Numerical diagonalization for various lattice models. Currently supported algorithms: 
<ol type="1">
    <li>Symmetrized Basis (currently only support translation symmetry. will add point group soon.)
    <li>Eigen states (PARPACKSolver) and observable  measurment</li>
    <li>Dynamic Structure Factor (LANCZOSSolver)</li>
    <li>Time Evolution (Krylov Subspace Algorithm)</li>
</ol>
